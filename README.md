Pretty good if I may say so!

Still needs lots of love.

Maybe it will grow into big super tester one day!

To Do:

Concurrent calls to actual() may cause out of order logs
ascertain whether that happens and fix it with promises or something
Now you can try running the async tests for me and see if your logs
are interleaved at all. Anything out of the normal pattern in your logs?
Works for me! So that's pretty neat. All the RW tests are not executed in order
but at least their logs are, that's what I'm goin for.

Too good to be true speed? RW 100 files in 0.096s?
