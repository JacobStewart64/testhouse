Pretty good if I may say so!

Still needs lots of love.

Maybe it will grow into big super tester one day!

To Do:

Make option to run tests async
Make final log appear after all tests are done
Concurrent calls to actual() may cause out of order logs
ascertain whether that happens and fix it with promises or something
