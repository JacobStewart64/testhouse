Pretty good if I may say so!

Still needs lots of love.

Maybe it will grow into big super tester one day!

To Do:

Make option to run tests async
Make final log appear after all tests are done
Concurrent calls to actual() may cause out of order logs
ascertain whether that happens and fix it with promises or something

Now you can try running the async tests for me and see if your logs
are interleaved at all. Anything out of the normal pattern in your logs?
Works for me! So that's pretty neat.
